# Quantum-Espresso-DOP

Calculations done under DOP using Quantum Espresso


Calculation of scf, convergence test using plane-wave cutoff, bandstructure graph for:
Silicon, Aluminium, Copper, Nickel, Silver, Iron


Single-layer Graphene- scf, non-scf, bandstructure


Bi-layer graphene- scf, non-scf, bandstructure for both aa and ab type, as well as a case of sliding two AA bilayers above one another. DOS graphs for the bilayer have also been computed.
