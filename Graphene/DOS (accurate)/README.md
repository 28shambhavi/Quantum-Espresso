This is a calculation of the Density of states for AB bilayer.

Here, K points values taken are 48 48  1 0 0 0 in scf calculation

And 96 96 1 0 0 0 in nscf calculation

The final graph is under the name dos_graph_ab. Can be viewed on xmgracre software.

It shows the values of Density of States for both up spin and down spin.
