This is a calculation of the Density of states for AA bilayer.

Here, K points values taken are 12 12 1 0 0 0

The final graph is under the name spin_graph. 

It shows the values of Density of States for both up spin and down spin. The fermi energy has been centeres to show the graph of DOS vs E-E(f)
