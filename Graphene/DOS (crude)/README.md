This is a calculation of the Density of states for AA bilayer.

Here, K points values taken are 12 12 1 0 0 0

The final graph is under the name spin_graph. Can be viewed on xmgracre software.

It shows the values of Density of States for both up spin and down spin. The fermi energy has been centered to show the graph of DOS vs E-E(f)
